# Confirming Navigation

You can prevent a transition from happening or prompt the user before leaving a
[route](/docs/Glossary.md#route) with a leave hook. Leave hooks can be
asynchronous if you accept the second `callback` parameter, except in the case
of beforeUnload hooks which must always be synchronous.

```js
const Home = withRouter(
  React.createClass({

    componentDidMount() {
      this.props.router.setRouteLeaveHook(this.props.route, this.routerWillLeave)
    },

    routerWillLeave(nextLocation, callback) {
      if (callback !== undefined) {
        doSomethingAsync().then(callback)
      } else {  // This is the beforeUnload case.
        // Return false to prevent a transition w/o prompting the user,
        // or return a string to allow the user to decide:
        if (!this.state.isSaved)
          return 'Your work is not saved! Are you sure you want to leave?'
      }
    },

    // ...

  })
)
```

Note that this example makes use of the [withRouter](/upgrade-guides/v2.4.0.md) higher-order component introduced in v2.4.0.
